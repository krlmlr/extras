<!-- badges: end -->

`extras` provides basic functions for Bayesian analyses; functions to
summarise MCMC samples; and R translations of a handful of common
functions from modeling languages such as BUGS/JAGS and C++ (STAN and
TMB).

## Installation

<!-- To install the latest release from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) -->

To install the developmental version from
[GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/extras)

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/extras")
```

To install the latest developmental release from the Poisson drat
[repository](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/drat)

``` r
# install.packages("drat")
drat::addRepo("poissonconsulting")
install.packages("extras")
```

## Demonstration

### Simple Generics

The `extras` package provides simple S3 generics from the universals
package like `dims()`.

``` r
library(extras)

x <- 1:10
dim(x) # base R (returns NULL)
#> NULL
dims(x)
#> [1] 10
```

as well as those to summarise MCMC samples like `svalue()` which gives
the *surprisal value* (Greenland, 2019)

``` r
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
svalue(rnorm(100))
#> [1] 0.3183615
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 1))
#> [1] 1.704015
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 2))
#> [1] 3.850857
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 3))
#> [1] 5.073249
```

## R translations

The package also provides R translations of BUGS/JAGS functions such as
`log<-` and `logit<-`.

``` r
mu <- NULL
log(mu) <- 1
mu
#> [1] 2.718282
```

And C++ functions such as `pow()`.

``` r
2^3 # base R
#> [1] 8
pow(2, 3)
#> [1] 8
```
