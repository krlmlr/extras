`extras` provides basic functions for Bayesian analyses; 
functions to summarise MCMC samples; and R translations of a handful of common functions 
from modeling languages such as BUGS/JAGS and C++ (STAN and TMB).
    
## Installation

<!-- To install the latest release from [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org) -->
```{r, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
install.packages("extras")
```

To install the developmental version from [GitHub](https://github.com/poissonconsulting/extras)
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("poissonconsulting/extras")
```

## Demonstration

### Summarise MCMC Samples

The `extras` package provides functions to summarise MCMC samples like `svalue()` which gives the *surprisal value* (Greenland, 2019)

```{r}
set.seed(1)
x <- rnorm(100)
svalue(rnorm(100))
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 1))
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 2))
svalue(rnorm(100, mean = 3))
```

## R translations

The package also provides R translations of BUGS/JAGS functions such as `log<-` and `logit<-`.

```{r}
mu <- NULL
log(mu) <- 1
mu
```

And STAN (C++) functions such as `pow()`.

```{r}
2^3 # base R
pow(2, 3)
```
